# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis
## Overview
*- This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Emergency Room (ER) operations in a hospital.*
It has two levels:
- Consolidated View (Yearly) â€“ Summarizes data from April 2023 to October 2024.
- Monthly View (Example: August 2023) â€“ Provides in-depth analysis for a single month.
 
  ---
## 1. Objective
- The goal of this dashboard project is to analyze Emergency Room (ER) performance at a hospital across different time frames. It provides both a consolidated yearly-level view (April 2023 â€“ October 2024) and a granular monthly-level view (example: August 2023).
- By monitoring critical KPIs such as number of patients, waiting times, admission rates, referrals, demographics, and satisfaction scores, this project helps administrators identify patterns, bottlenecks, and opportunities for improving hospital operations.

## 3. Process / Methodology
- The dashboard development followed these steps:
#### Data Collection
- Patient records over 18 months were gathered.
- Variables included demographics (age, gender, race), treatment outcomes (admitted/not admitted), wait times, referrals, and patient satisfaction.
- Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicates and corrected missing values.
- Standardized age ranges into categories (0â€“9, 10â€“19, etc.).
- Grouped referrals into hospital departments.
#### Dashboard Design
- Built four dashboards for different decision-making levels:
- Yearly (Consolidated) â€“ Long-term trends and cumulative performance.
- Monthly â€“ Detailed view of a single month for granular insights.
- Patients History Details.
- Keytakeaways.
#### Visualization Approach
- KPIs Cards â€“ High-level summary metrics (Patients, Wait Time, Satisfaction, Referrals).
- Pie & Bar Charts â€“ Admissions, Age Groups, Gender, Referrals, Race distribution.
- Line/Bar by Time â€“ Day of week and hour analysis to capture workload peaks.

## 6. Key Insights
- High Patient Load â€“ Over 9,200 patients in 18 months, requiring consistent staff resources.
- Efficient Wait Times â€“ Majority seen within 30 minutes, though ~40% still wait longer.
- Strong Patient Satisfaction â€“ Scores near 5.0, indicating effective communication and treatment.
- Balanced Admissions â€“ Roughly half admitted, half discharged, showing proper triage.
- Young Adults Dominate â€“ ER usage is highest in 20â€“39 age groups, possibly due to accidents, lifestyle diseases, or higher activity levels.
- Weekends & Mondays are Peak â€“ These need extra staffing and resource allocation.
- Department Referrals â€“ General Practice and Orthopedics lead, highlighting common health issues.
- Race & Diversity â€“ White and African American groups dominate, but multicultural representation exists.
- Hourly Peaks â€“ Morning 8â€“12 AM surge requires optimized scheduling of doctors and nurses.
- Monthly Snapshot â€“ August 2023 showed slightly longer wait times, but higher satisfaction, suggesting staff managed well despite load.

## 7. Conclusion
- The Emergency Room is performing strongly in patient satisfaction and overall efficiency. However, certain operational challenges exist:
- Load Balancing Needed: Weekends, Mondays, and morning rush hours require extra manpower.
- Wait Time Reduction: While 59% within 30 mins is good, further reducing delays for the remaining 41% can enhance efficiency.
- Targeted Resource Allocation: Since referrals are concentrated in General Practice and Orthopedics, those departments may need additional specialists.
- Focus on Young Adults: Outreach programs and preventive measures could reduce frequent ER visits by this age group.
- Overall, the ER has achieved an excellent service balanceâ€”high patient volume, short wait times, and very high satisfaction. With minor adjustments in staffing strategy and referral handling, performance can improve even further.
